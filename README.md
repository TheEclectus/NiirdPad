Still WIP, but saved files will be forward-compatible with all future releases.
Currently not written with others compiling it in mind. The Releases tab has a working exe with all the trimmings.

## TODO:
- UI backend overhaul (goodbye, Qt?)
- TUscript database management
- TUscript version selection
- File extension association
- Premake5 compatibility
