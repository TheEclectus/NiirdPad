1. Definitions
--------------
	Comment
		A note that can be added to a Node. Does not display in-game, nor does it affect
		the flow of branching dialogue in any way.

	Dialogue
		Functions executed and lines of text to be displayed indicating a character's 
		spoken lines and/or actions. 
		Always has an Index, and is paired with a single Input Nub.

	Function
		A TUScript operation that affects the game's state, and may or may not affect the
		destination Index of a particular Option.

	Node
		A Node is a single dialogue-response hub, consisting of one or more Dialogues 
		and one or more Options. 
		May optionally contain a comment.

	Nub (Input, Output)
		A Nub is a connection point between a Dialogue and an Option. Input Nubs may only
		be connected to Output Nubs. In the event that an Output Nub has more than one
		possible destination because of an index-modifying Function, a context menu will
		be displayed for the user to select which branching path is to be connected.

	Option
		Lines of text to be displayed if accompanying Visibility conditions are met, with
		Functions that are executed if the player selects the Option.
		Paired with a single Output Nub.
