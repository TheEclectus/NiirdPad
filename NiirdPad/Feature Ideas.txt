- Import single characters instead of an entire project
- Finish up Lua file definitions (showif.<stat>.x)
- Remove trailing whitespace from dialogue and option text(?)
- Fix graphicsboxes outgrowing their parents
- Make newlines obvious in editors
- Space on newline?

Bit (test_falmilen):

(Features)
- Zooming in/out
- Search function for text
- Multiple selection of nodes, either through a selection box or a shift-click, so that you can move multiple at a time
- Change font size option in nodes and edit fragment window. Right now it's too small for my liking.
- Creating a new node should create one dialogue and option fragment in it automatically
- Spell checking. Could have a spell checker in the fragment editor, and have a spell checker that checks the entire file for errors.
- Syntax highlighting for dialogue. Have a different text color for text box description and dialogue in quotation marks. Formatting tags (<b>, <br>, etc) could be highlighted too.
- Word count display
- Ability to reorder fragments within a node.
- Ability to pan the view without the cursor being stopped by the edge of the screen.
(Interface)
- Change the curves. The curving on them is too much, making the lines hard to read sometimes. It also has this quirk where it can curve way too far creating a mess https://gyazo.com/518aecc87d521d41eb2f517c76c5122b
- Anti-alias the lines, since I hate jaggies.
- Make the background of the fragment slightly transparent. It will make it a lot easier to see where connections are going.
- A nice subtle effect would be to highlight all the connections from a highlighted node. You could make all the connections grey and highlighted ones white for this.
- Hide or make the sidebar smaller, since it wastes a good amount of space.
- Dark mode.
(Bugs)
- The comment section doesn't expand for longer comments
